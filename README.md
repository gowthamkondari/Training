Inheritance in C++ is taking the attributes and functionality of the desired class without writing the same code in our class. 
Understanding inheritance is essential if want to improve your programming abilities in C++. 

Inheritance is a basic object-oriented programming (OOP) concept in C++ that allows one class to inherit the attributes and functions of another. 
This means that the derived class can use all of the base class's members as well as add its own. Because it reduces the need to duplicate code for comparable classes, inheritance promotes code reusability and maintainability.


Why use Inheritance in C++?:


By allowing you to inherit common members from a base class into derived classes, inheritance increases code reusability.
This eliminates the need for duplicating code and reduces the total coding effort.
Inheritance aids in the hierarchical organization of code by reflecting the links between various classes.
This improves the readability and maintainability of the code.
Inheritance is the foundation for polymorphism, allowing objects of different classes to respond to the same method calls in different ways.
This increases C++ object-oriented program flexibility and extension.


Types of Inheritance Classes

There are two types of Inheritance Classes in C++:

Base Class

Derived Class

1. Derived Class
A derived class inherits the base class's properties and methods. The derived class can inherit all of the base class's attributes and methods or only a subset of them. The derived class may additionally include its own set of properties and methods.

2. Base Class
A base class is one that other classes inherit from. The base class defines the attributes and methods that its derived classes inherit. In addition, the base class can specify its properties and methods.
