Abstraction
It is a way of shielding the user from unimportant information like the implementation.

Consider a scenario where someone is downloading and uploading files. He is aware of the appropriate alternatives to select. 
He will click the appropriate button to begin uploading or downloading the material. Your phone will display if the file has been downloaded or uploaded. 
As it is irrelevant to you, what occurs on the server when you press send is concealed from you. When someone clicks upload or download, just the section the user wants to view is displayed; 
the background activity that occurs is concealed from him.
