**UNIVERSITY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM:**

The university management system is a software application designed to manage and automate various administrative tasks of a university.This system mainly focuse on the university departments, courses and students in that departments and courses.The system aims to streamline the processes,improve efficiency, and enhance the overall experience for students,faculty and other staff.


The following topics are covered in this code:

1. *Encapsulation*: Each class encapsulates its attributes and methods, hiding implementation details from other classes.

2. *Abstraction*: The classes abstract the essential features of a university, departments, courses, and students, ignoring non-essential details.

3. *Inheritance*: Although not explicitly shown in this example, inheritance can be used to create a hierarchy of course types (e.g., UndergraduateCourse, GraduateCourse) that inherit common attributes and methods from a base Course class.

4. *Polymorphism*: The `display_departments` method in the University class, the `display_courses` method in the Department class, and the `display_students` method in the Course class demonstrate polymorphism, as they can work with different types of departments, courses, and students.

5. *Logging*: The code uses Python's built-in logging module to log events and errors, demonstrating the use of logging in OOPS.

6. *Docstrings*: The code uses docstrings to provide documentation for classes, methods, and functions, demonstrating the use of docstrings in OOPS.
