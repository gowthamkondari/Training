C++ supports the following five types of inheritance:

1.Single inheritance
2.Multiple inheritance
3.Multilevel inheritance
4.Hierarchical inheritance
5.Hybrid inheritance

1. Single Inheritance in C++

When a child/derived class inherits only one base/parent class, it is called a single inheritance.

2. Multiple Inheritance in C++

When a child/derived class inherits from more than one base/parent class, it is called multiple inheritance.

3. Multilevel Inheritance in C++

When one base class is inherited by a derived class which is further inherited by any other derived class, it is known as multilevel inheritance.
Here, a derived class becomes the base class of another derived class. In the end, the last derived class acquires all the members of all its base classes.

4. Hierarchical Inheritance in C++

If more than one derived class inherits a single base class, a hierarchy of base classes is formed and so it is known as hierarchical inheritance.

5. Hybrid Inheritance in C++

It is the combination of more than one type of inheritance i.e hybrid variety of inheritance.
